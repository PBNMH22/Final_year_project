Electronic Ration Card with Fingerprint Authentication
The Indian government provides number of food stuffs to their citizens in miserable rates to full fill the requirement of food in remote areas also, to provide the wealth and to eradicate famine starvation. An official document provided by the state governments in India to the families that are eligible to purchase food grains at subsidized rates.
These food grains are delivered to the families with the help of PDS (public Distribution system)
There are three types of ration cards issued by the government are :
1.	APL (Above Poverty Line )
2.	BPL (Below poverty Line )
3.	AAY  (Antyodaya) 
These are provided by the priority, defined by the National Food Security Act[4]. 
There are many problems with conventional PDS systems like millions of  ineligible and fraud ration cards gets  the benefits; at the same time there are many poor families having no Ration Cards.
Shop owners divert rationing grains to open market. To overcome such frauds and black market practices.
We have designed Electronic Ration Card with Finger Print Authentication.
 In this project work, we have to take the fingerprints of every member of ration card holder family.
 By collecting this data we can monitor the need of food grains of every family according to number of family members.
 By using this huge collection of data, we can call it as a big data we can analyze the need of grains and other food stuffs of the nation and according to this we can import or export the agricultural outcomes.
 The data we have gathered can be used to implement number of policies and schemes to eradicate the poverty.
